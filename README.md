# Series of low-level code projects done using the TI-MSP432 Evaluation Board
Board was attached to a two motor wheelbase with bump sensors and a 8-point IR sensor underneath.

Projects include:
- Finite State Machine implementation using an IR sensor for line-following capability
- Motor Control using PWM (system timer-based, interrupt-based)
- Tachometer with PID control loop
